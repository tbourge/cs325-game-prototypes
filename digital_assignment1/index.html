<h2>Chemistry Woes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<br>The requirement that the blocks be hit from above.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<br>Not much... I added a couple of lines to add sounds and compare the height of the ball to the block it hit.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<br>Phaser basics, audio setup.
<br>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<br>Easiest: Modifying the code to compare the height of the ball and block.
<br>Hardest: Changing the graphics.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Potion Picture: <a href="https://www.kissclipart.com/potion-png-clipart-potion-computer-icons-g92ckj/">Kissclipart.com</a></li>

<li>Bottle Open Sound: <a href="https://www.soundjay.com/drink-sounds-1.html">Soundjay.com</a></li>
<li>All other assets were made by me.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<br>I took most of the code from the <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/breakout/breakout">Phaser Breakout Example</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<br>You need to open all of the chemicals needed for class, but don't want to get up, so why not use this bouncy ball and eraser?
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<br>Chemist.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<br>Input: Mouse
<br>Randomness: Deterministic
<br>Genre: Arcade, Puzzle and/or Shooter
<br>Play Style: Director or Joker
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<br>Basic physics interactions and angular prediction.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<br>I am hoping they have fun with my slightly harder version of Breakout. My intent was to provide an increased challenge without causing frustration.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<br>The eraser follows the player's mouse's horizontal position. Clicking launches the ball upward. The ball will bounce off the eraser and edges of the screen except for the bottom. If the ball falls off the bottom of the screen it will reset attached to the eraser. The chemical bottles will only "open" (dissapear) if they are hit from above (or at a high point on the side). If all of the bottles are opened the game will reset. 
<br>Tip: If the ball hits the eraser off-center it will bounce slightly that direction.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<br>Patience and angular prediction. If you do not get a good angle you may need to wait until the ball ends up in a good spot again. The ability to know where the ball is going to go after it bounces is essential.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<br>A student was given a boring job and found a more fun way to complete it. They are definitely in a school. Other than that I haven't got a clue. The protagonist does not have a name and the only other person that definitely exists in the world is the teacher that gave them the task of opening the bottles. They also don't have a name.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<br>Bored students or anyone looking for a quick game to pass the time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<br>2-5 minutes
</li>
