Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<br>This game feels a bit like a <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/WarioWare_(series)">Wario Ware micro-game</a>. It also has a similar structure to <a href="digital_assignment4">my 2nd game</a> although this is not an iteration of that game.
<br>I borrowed code from:
