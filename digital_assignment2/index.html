<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<br>I made all of the graphics myself. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<br>Not much. I used timers to set up the events but they are very simple.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<br>Timers, animations, audio loops, volume changes, text basics, and keyboard inputs.
<br>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<br>Hardest: Finding sound effects that fit and were free.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<li>I made all other assets</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<br>This game feels a bit like a <a href="https://cookingmama.fandom.com/wiki/Cooking_Mama_(Series)">Cooking Mama</a> minigame. I don't know of a specific "closest game".
<br>I borrowed code from:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/animation/animation-from-png-sequence">Animation From Png Sequence Phaser Example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/input/keyboard/just-down">Just Down Phaser Example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/time/pause-and-resume">Pause And Resume Phaser Example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/audio/web-audio/basic-playback-and-events">Basic Playback And Events Phaser Example</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<br>You need to cook your soup to perfection, don't let it burn!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<br>Ebullient and the 20 second challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<br>Input: Keyboard
<br>Randomness: Deterministic
<br>Genre: Skill, Puzzle
<br>Play Style: Competitor, Joker
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<br>Timing. Specifically, the ability to accurately measure 20 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<br>A sense of accomplishment at their ability to measure time accurately. Maybe some friendly competition with other players trying to beat eachother's scores.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<br>The player can press SPACEBAR to start cooking and pressing SPACEBAR again will stop cooking. The player will earn more points the closer to 20 seconds <br>they stop. Their score will drop quickly if the soup burns. Pressing SPACEBAR again will reset the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<br>Consistent counting and practice.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<br>The game is meant to be more abstract than story heavy. The game is simply about a man trying to make his dinner. He gets upset if it is ruined. 
<br>He is happy if it turns out well.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<br>People who want a quick challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<br>20 seconds to win and 21 seconds to lose.
</li>
