What is original about your game?

<br>Not much. I used timers to set up the events but they are very simple.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<br>Timers, animations, and keyboard inputs.
<br>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<br>Hardest: Finding sound effects that fit and were free.
</li>

<li>I made all other assets</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<br>This game feels a bit like a <a href="https://cookingmama.fandom.com/wiki/Cooking_Mama_(Series)">Cooking Mama</a> minigame. I don't know of a specific "closest game".
<br>I borrowed code from:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/animation/animation-from-png-sequence">Animation From Png Sequence Phaser Example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/input/keyboard/just-down">Just Down Phaser Example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/time/pause-and-resume">Pause And Resume Phaser Example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/audio/web-audio/basic-playback-and-events">Basic Playback And Events Phaser Example</a></li>
