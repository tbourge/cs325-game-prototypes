<h2>Target Practice</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<br>I came up with the concept on my own, though I'm sure you can find other games just like it somewhere. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<br>I combined physics elements from different examples in a unique way.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<br>Physics elements are hard to work with when you don't know what classes to use. Animations from sprite sheet.
<br>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<br>Hardest: Getting the physics working.
<br> Easiest: Making sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Pirate: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/classic-pirate-captain-animated">Classic Pirate Captain [Animated]</a></li>
<li>Death Sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Cigaro30/sounds/420932/">Male grunt Uh</a></li>
<li>Pirate: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Kneeling/sounds/448002/">Monster Game Effects » cannon.mp3</a></li>
<li>All other assets were made by me.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<br>The closest game that I know of is <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/breakout/breakout">Breakout</a>. Sure you could find something more similar with a bit of effort.
<br>I borrowed code from:

</ul></li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
