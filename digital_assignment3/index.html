<h2>Target Practice</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<br>I came up with the concept on my own, though I'm sure you can find other games just like it somewhere. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<br>I combined physics elements from different examples in a unique way.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<br>Physics elements are hard to work with when you don't know what classes to use. Animations from sprite sheet.
<br>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<br>Hardest: Getting the physics working.
<br> Easiest: Making sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Pirate: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/classic-pirate-captain-animated">Classic Pirate Captain [Animated]</a></li>
<li>Death Sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Cigaro30/sounds/420932/">Male grunt Uh</a></li>
<li>Cannon sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Kneeling/sounds/448002/">Monster Game Effects » cannon.mp3</a></li>
<li>All other assets were made by me.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<br>The closest game that I know of is <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/breakout/breakout">Breakout</a>. I am sure you could find something more similar with a bit of effort.
<br>I borrowed code from:

</ul></li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<br>You need to keep the enemy Pirates from getting off the island but your cannoneers have terrible aim and need you to show them where to shoot.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<br>Pirate.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<br>Input: Indirect
<br>Randomness: Some Randomness
<br>Genre: Shooter
<br>Play Style: Competitor
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<br>The player's ability to indirectly target a moving object with a limited amount of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<br>A fun challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<br>Move the mouse up and down to move the target. The cannon will move to match the height of the target automatically. The cannon will fire automatically. <br>Shoot the incoming Pirates before they get to the right side of the screen or you lose. If you survive 3 minutes you win. Click to start the game and 
<br>click to reset once the game is over.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<br>Speed and accuracy.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<br>You've tracked a rival gang of pirates to their hideout. You've got the element of surprise and a cannon, but there are far more of them.
<br>The player should feel the struggle of fighting against a large number of enemies and the relief of success when the game ends.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<br>People who want a simple, quick, shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<br>3 minutes or less.
</li>
