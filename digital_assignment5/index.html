<h2>Target Practice v2</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<br>I came up with the concept on my own. I made most of the visual assets as well. Since the last iteration I:
<ul>
<li>Added cannonball explosion animations</li>
<li>Added background music</li>
<li>Added cannonball explosion sounds</li>
<li>Removed the grunt sound</li>
<li>Moved the target to the right so that it did not appear to be above the top of the boarding platforms</li>
<li>Shortened the game time by a minute to keep it from getting repetitive</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<br>I combined physics elements from different examples in a unique way. Since my last iteration I: 
<ul>
<li>Randomized the pirate movement</li>
<li>Fixed the Pirates so that the game ends when they reached the water, as I intended originally</li>
<li>Make Pirates die when hitting an explosion</li>
<li>Prevented the target from moving so close to the edge of the screen</li>
<li>Fixed the first cycle of the cannon animation</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<br>Physics elements are hard to work with when you don't know what classes to use. Animations from sprite sheet.
<br>What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<br>Hardest: Getting the physics working.
<br> Easiest: Making sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<br>You need to keep the enemy Pirates from getting off the island but your cannoneers have terrible aim and need you to show them where to shoot.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<br>Pirate.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<br>Input: Indirect
<br>Randomness: Some Randomness
<br>Genre: Shooter
<br>Play Style: Competitor
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<br>The player's ability to indirectly target a moving object with a limited amount of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<br>A fun challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<br>Move the mouse up and down to move the target. The cannon will move to match the height of the target automatically. The cannon will fire automatically. <br>Shoot the incoming Pirates before they get to the water on the right side of the screen or you lose. If you survive 2 minutes you win. Click to start the <br>game and click to reset once the game is over.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<br>Speed and accuracy. Waiting for the right shop to line up so that you can hit multiple Pirates with one explosion.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<br>You've tracked a rival gang of pirates to their hideout. You've got the element of surprise and a cannon, but there are far more of them.
<br>The player should feel the struggle of fighting against a large number of enemies and the relief of success when the game ends.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<br>People who want a simple, quick, shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<br>2 minutes or less.
</li>
